This repository has the code and cases for the y+-adapative wall function in immersed boundary method. The new method helps smooth the wall shear, which is important for sediment transport. 

The code is developed with OpenFOAM v3.0.1. To use this code, it is required that OpenFOAM v3.0.1 has been properly installed. Current code has only been used in Linux. Porting to Windows and Mac OS have not been done, but possible. Updating the current code to new versions of OpenFOAM is also possible.

This code utilizes some data structure and implementation of an immersed boundary method in the OpenFOAM-extend project. Details can be found in the citations and references of the following paper:
