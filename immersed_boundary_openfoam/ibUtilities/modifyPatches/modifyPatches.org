* Purpose
This utility is developed to manipulate the 
"constant/polyMesh/boundary" file automatically. 
This is useful when using utilities like /splitMesh/ or 
/splitMeshWithSets/ . It is also useful for importing 
mesh from other software (e.g. Gmsh). The utility can:
   - Change the type of a non-null patch (of size 
     greater than zero) to: empty, wall, wedge, symmetry, 
     cyclic or processor
   - Remove a given null patch
   - Create a null patch of a given name at the end of the 
     "constant/polyMesh/boundary" file

*Description*: modifyPatches is an application 
developed by Hisham El Safti 
hsafti@gmial.com in January 2013

*Purpose*: Manipulates the constant/polyMesh/boundary 
file to modify patches 
from patch type to wall, empty, wedge, cyclic,
symmetryPlane or processor. 
This is helpful to use with /gmshToFoam/. 
The utility allows addition and 
removal of null patches for use with /splitMesh/.

*Examples of use*

#+BEGIN_SRC <sh> 
  modifyPatches -empty frontAndBack 
  modifyPatches -null Master
#+END_SRC

* Notes
   - The "constant/polyMesh/boundary" file is overwritten
   - The application can read one value for each option (for 
     two empty patches use 
     the utility twice)
   - The processor patch is set to 0 processor and 1 neighbour
     processor by default
   - The cyclic patch does not add a neighbourPatch keyword
